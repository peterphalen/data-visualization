# Mapping police killings
R scripts that generate interactive online visualizations of police killings. Uses US census data, a file scraped from the Guardian's The Counted website for pre-2017 data, and a file scraped from the Washington Post for post-2017 (some GIS assembly required). 

For the output of the map-police-killings.R script go here:
